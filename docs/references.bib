    Euclidean distance geometry is the study of Euclidean geometry based on the concept of distance. This is useful in several applications where the input data consist of an incomplete set of distances and the output is a set of points in Euclidean space realizing those given distances. We survey the theory of Euclidean distance geometry and its most important applications, with special emphasis on molecular conformation problems. }

    abstract = {Publisher Summary
    This chapter presents various fundamental algorithms to the electronic design automation (EDA) research and developmentâ€”from the classic graphic theories, the practical heuristic approaches, and then to the theoretical mathematical programming techniques. The chapter goes through the fundamentals of algorithms that are essential for the readers to appreciate the various EDA technologies. Many of the EDA problems can be either represented in graph data structures or transformed into graph problems. The most representative ones, in which the efficient algorithms have been well studied, are elaborated. The readers should be able to use these graph algorithms in solving many of their research problems. Heuristic algorithms that yield suboptimal, yet reasonably good results are usually adopted as practical approaches. Several selected heuristic algorithms are also covered. The mathematical programming algorithms, which provide the theoretical analysis for the problem optimality, are explored and the mathematical programming problems that are the most common in the EDA applications are focused on.}
